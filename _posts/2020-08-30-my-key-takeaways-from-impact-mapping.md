I received [the Impact Mapping book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16084015-impact-mapping) as a gift from my company, [Telstra Purple](https://purple.telstra.com.au/). It's been in my long reading backlog for a while, but I finally got around to reading it on the weekend and found it a great and easy read while being full of gems. A lot of the concepts resonated with me, especially because I already knew about the concept, but I still picked up a few ideas. Here are the golden nuggets I wrote down as I was reading the book:<!--more-->

-  For all software projects (and most other endeavours), focus on a shared understanding of four key questions with stakeholders:
   - _Why_ [are we doing this?]. This is your _goal_.
   - _Who_ [can influence the outcome?]. These are your _actors_.
   - _How_ [can they influence the outcome?]. These are your _impacts_.
   - _What_ [can we do to support or reduce the outcomes?]. These are your _deliverables_.
  
   In that order. Always start with the why, but all of them are key. Without any one of them, you'll end up building the wrong thing.

-  If you're lost on arriving at a good _why_, keep asking it until you get to the money (_i.e._ someone's boat ðŸ˜‰).

-  Finding good questions is more important and difficult than finding good answers.

-  The critical component is neither the cause, nor the effect, but rather the validity of the assumption that links them.

-  You should do your best so people on the ground and doing the work understand the _why_. This results in superior solutions. In reality, these people are rarely privy to the information and it mostly exists in the back of senior stakeholders' minds. Just knowing the _how_ and _what_ is not enough for teams to make the best decisions.

-  Environments that focus only on the _whats_ are usually the worst, bums-on-seats places to work at.

-  Impact mapping makes it easy to identify solutions looking for a problem. _i.e._, "We need to do microservices/blockchain/k8s/etc."

-  _Who_, _how_ and _what_ map nicely to the common user story template clauses of "As a [who], I want [what], so that [how]". Use this frame of thinking to stop writing user stories like "As a system, I want a customer report" or "As a trader, I want a trading system, so that I can trade"!

-  Goals and impacts should be [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). Beware of "vanity" metrics which are the result of a psychological tendency to measure what's easily measured and makes people feel good, rather than what can inform good decisions.

-  Don't mistake metrics for goals.

-  If you achieve your goal with a different scope than planned, have you succeeded? if the answer is no, then you don't have the right metrics.

-  The _what_ forms your detailed backlog. The aim in delivery should always be to focus on items connected to the most impactful _hows_ and _whos_ and finding the shortest path to the _why_, not to implement all backlog items. Achieving goals is what matters, not delivering the highest number of features.

-  Similarly, going to market and shipping software should not be the goal. The goal should be to make a measurable impact after that happens.

-  The initial vision should not be set in stone. We live in a rapidly changing world, especially when it comes to software. The vision should be a living artefact, like most other inputs that feed into software development. Don't do [Water-Scrum-fall](https://sdtimes.com/agile/analyst-watch-water-scrum-fall-is-the-reality-of-agile/)!

-  What the user/customer wants to get done is much more important than their ideas on how to do it. They are not the technology/solution experts.

-  Many teams fail to engage business people because they ask them to focus on prioritising the _whats_ (individual backlog items), while business people are much better engaged and make better decisions when discussing priorities on _whos_ and _hows_. Prioritising actors and impacts is much more important than prioritising user stories. 

-  If you follow agile and iterative processes without connecting them to measurables and the overall goal, it's like saying:

   > "We don't know exactly where we'll go, but small steps ensure we don't fall down."
  
   So you might end up in a totally irrelevant place, successfully!

There are many online mind mapping tools you can use to create impact maps. [MindMup](https://www.mindmup.com/) is a good one.
